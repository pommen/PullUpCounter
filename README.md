# PullupCounter
Simple counter that keeps track of how many pullups that has been done in a day and displays it on a double led array display.
Resets every day and only lights up during office hours. This is done with a DS1307 RTC.
Manually changeable with a encoder, to "cheat" or correct the amont of sweat that has been done.
